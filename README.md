# Forging Python

This is the source code for the book [Forging
Python](http://forging-python.com).

The book is written with [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com) and using
[Markdown][md].

Most of the tasks are automated in the Makefile.

Published chapters are the ones in [Book.txt](Book.txt) (the lines *not* starting
with `#`). Chapters that are commented out in `Book.txt` are at pre-alpha stage.

To generate HTML preview, run `make site`. This will generate HTML files in the
`site` directory using the [kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org) utility.
