**Graybeard:** In other news ... I'm going to be away for a while.

**Youngstar:** Where are you going to hike this time?

**Graybeard:** The Appalachian trail, not sure I'll do all of it but I'll
probably be offline for a month.

**Youngstar:** That's awesome! Send pictures.

**Graybeard:** What part of offline don't you understand?

**Youngstar:** Doh! Oh wait... who's going to help me then?

**Graybeard:** Don't you have other friends?

**Youngstar:** Yes, but they don't know Python and other programming skills like
you.

**Graybeard:** Arguably, the most important skill you'll acquire as a developer
is the ability to ask good questions[^ibm]. Let's talk a bit on how you can get
help somewhere other than here.

**Youngstar:** OK, but I do expect to meet you here regularly when you're back.

**Graybeard:** Of course. Where do you go to find answers now?

**Youngstar:** Google.

**Graybeard:** Google is a good start. How are your search skills?

**Youngstar:** Hmm, never thought of that. I'd guess I'm an average googler.

**Graybeard:** Searching is important, invest time in getting better.  Google
has some excellent free online courses on searching called [Power
Searching][psearch]. As a rule of thumb add `python` to every query.

**Youngstar:** Neat, I'll do that. Another place I usually find myself is
[StackOverflow][so].

**Graybeard:** Yeah, they have great SEO.

**Youngstar:** SEO? I can't keep up with all these acronyms.

**Graybeard:** Nobody can, I use [acronymfinder][af] a lot of times. In this
case SEO stand for "search engine optimization".

**Youngstar:** I found out that most cases StackOverflow has the answer to what
I'm searching for.

**Graybeard:** Yeah, StackOverflow and the rest of StackExchange sites are a
great resource. Sometimes it's biased toward people who answer faster and not
necessarily give the best answer.

What happens when you don't find your answer in StackOverflow?

**Youngstar:** I ask there, most times I get an answer within an hour.

**Graybeard:** Edward Hodnett said "If you do not ask the right questions, you
do not get the right answers. A question asked in the right way often points to
its own answer." Do you ask the right questions?

**Youngstar:** I *think* so, not sure. Any guidelines?

**Graybeard:** I'll give you two reading assignments. One is ["How To Ask
Questions The Smart Way"][asksmart] by Eric Raymond where he goes into great
details on how to formulate questions. The second is a research done by takipi
people called "[The anatomy of a Great Stack Overflow Question][soq]".

**Youngstar:** Sure, I'll add them to my pile of things to read. Can you give me
the TL;DR?

**Graybeard:** (sighs) Sure, but it doesn't mean you're off the hook for reading
these.

**Youngstar:** Agree.

**Graybeard:** The two main points are respecting people's time and giving
enough context. If people feel that you're asking them a trivial question
instead of RTFM - they won't answer you. However if they see that you tried
something before asking them - they'll be more inclined to help. The other
thing is giving context. The worst questions you can get "Help, it doesn't
work".  Give enough information of what you were trying to do, what did you
expect to happen and what did actually happened.

**Youngstar:** This sounds a lot like bug reports.

**Graybeard:** Well, we're in a technical world - so a lot of things that don't
work seems like bugs. Check out [PBKAC][pbkac] acronym sometime.

Also be polite and make sure to thank people. Oh, and don't feed the trolls.

**Youngstar:** Trolls are the ones who argue for just for the sake of arguing?

**Graybeard:** Yeah, and they usually do it in a foul manner.

**Youngstar:** Any other advice?

**Graybeard:** Get a rubber duck.

**Youngstar:** What? Like the ones kids use in a bath?

**Graybeard:** What do you mean by "kids"? I have one like that.

**Youngstar:** For real?

**Graybeard:** You're never too old to have a bath with your rubber duck. Has
it ever happen to you that you were stuck on something, went to a co-worker for
help, started to describe the problem and somewhere in the middle said - "never
mind, I found the solution."?

**Youngstar:** Sure, several times. How does this relate to a rubber duck?

**Graybeard:** There's something about formulating our questions verbally or in
writing that helps us solve the problem. The idea here is that instead of
wasting a co-worker's time, you talk to the rubber duck. This is known as
[Rubber Ducking][rduck]. Place a rubber duck next to your monitor and describe
your problems to it when you're stuck.

**Youngstar:** Here goes my social life ... not that I had much of one.

**Graybeard:** You can also write it down instead of talking to the duck. But
try to do it as if explaining the problem to someone. Richard Feynman has 
[this algorithm][fa] for solving problems: 

1. Write down the problem.
2. Think real hard.
3. Write down the solution.

**Youngstar:** And this guy got a Nobel prize?

**Graybeard:** He was very smart. The first step is that one that relates to
our current discussion. Once you write the problem down, it'll be easier to
find a solution.

**Youngstar:** Got it. Back to the online world - any more good places?

**Graybeard:** Well, there's the good old Python newsgroup - comp.lang.python.
I access it via the [Google groups web interface][clp].

**Youngstar:** Newsgroup? It's still alive?

**Graybeard:** Yes, I lurk there and answer questions from time to time as well.

**Youngstar:** What about IRC?

**Graybeard:** That's a different mode of communication. So far we talked about
*async*[^async] communication where you ask a question and someone replies
where they can. Now we're moving to synchronous communication - very much like
the conversation we're having now.

**Youngstar:** Never thought about it like that.

**Graybeard:** Most people don't. One common mistake is to try to use one form
of communication as the other. Mostly people who think you should reply to an
email **right now**. But back to IRC - the `#python` IRC channel on freenode is
very busy with more than a thousand users logged in.

**Youngstar:** Whoa!

**Graybeard:** Yes. That's why they seem rude, but they're just trying to be
efficient. The room topic says: "don't ask to ask, just ask". If you're not
familiar with IRC jargon, take to time to learn it. My best advice is hang
around just reading conversations before you jump in the water.

**Youngstar:** I'll do that. Do people actually manage to talk in such noisy
environment?

**Graybeard:** Sure. Once you get the hang of it it can be fun - but time
consuming and require attention. This is synchronous communication after all.

**Youngstar:** So Google, StackOverflow, comp.lang.python and #python IRC
channel. Anything else?

**Graybeard:** I think that will give you enough for now. Since we're on the
subject of asking questions - let's talk on the questions you should ask
yourself.

**Youngstar:** I ask myself questions all the time.

**Graybeard:** I'm not talking about the usual day to day existential stuff.
I'm talking about work related questions.

**Youngstar:** Like retrospective?

**Graybeard:** Yes, we've covered that when talking about development process.
But it worth repeating. A lot of studies show that companies/groups who excel
at what they do, do a lot of retrospective/debriefing.

**Youngstar:** I was in some retrospectives where people got heated up.

**Graybeard:** Yes, don't just do a retrospective - do it well. Note that
retrospectives are not just for "end of sprint" but also for incidents. This is
where Toyota's ["5 whys"][5ys] come in handy.

**Youngstar:** OK, I'll brush up on how to do good retrospectives.

**Graybeard:** Other questions you should ask yourself are about the state of
things. I learned from a very talented person a trick about staying in focus.
The idea is to find one question, and keep asking it repeatedly. For example
"Why aren't we deploying?" - this will focus you on a JFDI attitude.

**Youngstar:** Language! I already gave you a pass on RTFM.

**Graybeard:** RTFM stand for "Read the Fine Manual", what's wrong with that?

**Youngstar:** Yeah, right!

**Graybeard:** But you're right. You should speak up whenever you feel the
environment get toxic. A good culture needs gardening all the time.

**Youngstar:** Thanks. I'll figure out a focusing mantra for me. Looks like a
fun exercise. Any other questions I should ask myself?

**Graybeard:** It depends on what you're doing and the state of things. For
example in ["Zero to One"][z21] Peter Theil writes about seven questions all
businesses must ask themselves.

**Youngstar:** And they are?...

**Graybeard:** Go read the book, it's a good one.

**Youngstar:** I'll need to rent a bigger place just to have room for all these
books.

**Graybeard:** Nah, just one Kindle to rule them all. You can also get an
online subscription to services like [Safari Book Online][safari] which give
you access to many books. Also public libraries in the U.S. let you borrow
books directly to your Kindle for free.

**Youngstar:** Handy!

**Youngstar:** Well, that will keep me covered until you get back. When do you
leave?

**Graybeard:** We have time for one more beer before you drive me to my flight.
