There is a saying: "I've learned a lot from my teachers, more from my peers
and most from my students."

I've been learning from teachers and peers for a long time, and love the
informal round table talks as a form of education. I try to implement this
method of teaching at my company 353solutions and people really like it. As a
bonus I'm learning so much from my students.

Terry Pratchett said "Writing is the most fun you can have by yourself." I had
great fun writing this book, not only from the writing process itself but also
from the discussions with many people who helped. I am grateful for anyone who
contributed and taught me along the way.

I hope this book will inspire you to come out and talk to people as a way of
learning. You will get many different perspectives on the problems your facing,
and as Alan Kay said: "A change in perspective is worth 80 IQ points."

This book is open source, feel free to head over to
https://github.com/tebeka/forging-python and submit bugs, offer ideas and ask
questions. I will do my best to improve this book according to your suggestions.

Happy Hacking,
