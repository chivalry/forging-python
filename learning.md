## Learning Python

Apart from the general Python forums, most big enough libraries have their own
forums or `stackoverflow` tags. It's usually best to start with a more specific
forum and if there no reply move to a more general one. A recent trend in the
last years is not to have a user forum but a `stackoverflow` tag, so if you can
find a forum, look for a tag in `stackoverflow`. I start with a search and see
that tags in the related questions.

## Learning Python
This book will not teach you how to program in Python, rather it will teach you
how to `work` with Python. There are many resources out there for learning
Python, from free eBooks to paid workshops. I will cover everything here, just
mention some free resources that I think are good. The best education of course
if *writing* Python code and getting peer reviewed.


### The Python Tutorial
If you already know how to program, 
[The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/) from the official
Python site is an excellent introduction to the language. It covers many topics
with good idiomatic examples.

### Code Academy
[Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python) has an interactive
Python course free of charge. They estimate it will take you about 13 hours to
finish and more than two million people have taken the course. The offer courses
in several other topics as well from
[HTML & CSS](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web) to
[JavaScript](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript) and more.

### Google Python Class
Google uses a lot of Python and offers a
[free class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/) the cover the
language basics and has several videos you can watch.

### eBooks
There are many books on Python, I don't have a favorite here but heard good
things about [A Byte of Python](http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/python/) and
[Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/). There
are many other good book out there, use your search skill to find the one best
for you.

### Open Source
The best way to learn a programming language is to write code in it and get some
feedback. Joining an open source project is one of the best ways to do that. I
suggest picking a framework you like or use, then going though the open bug list
and try to solve one of them. Note that most open source projects have "code
writing guidelines", make sure you read those before submitting code for review.
The open source community at large is friendly and grateful for help.
